This repository is work I did for Iota Omega Chapter of Omega Psi Phi
This project was bootstrapped with React App. 


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start' or if Yarn is installed 'yarn start'

Runs the app in the development mode.\
I recommend using [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the current version of the app in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
